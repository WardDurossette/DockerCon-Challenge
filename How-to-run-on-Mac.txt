How I got this to work on my Mac. 

I follow @jessfraz on Twitter, and saw a talk by her on YouTube in which she had X11 windows running, so I thought that might be a good place to start.

Googled “jessfraz X11 mount”, read her blog post here: https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/docker-containers-on-the-desktop/ 

In that post she refers to tricks to get it to work on Mac, with a link located here: https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/8710


What worked:


(Pre-game warmup - Update brew and brew cask) 
* brew update (already had brew installed from my dotNet core stuff.
* Had to install cask - brew install brew-cask

— commands I ran from a terminal window

— install socat
brew install socat

--install xquartz
brew cask install xquartz

--<reboot - because the DISPLAY environment variable was not set>

--open Quartz server
open -a XQuartz

--start a socat session
socat TCP-LISTEN:6000,reuseaddr,fork UNIX-CLIENT:\"$DISPLAY\"

--in another (second terminal window) window
--use ifconfig to find out the IP address of the VirtualBox
ifconfig ( look for the IP address associated with vboxnet0 )

--run the container, setting the DISPLAY to the IP
 docker run -it -e DISPLAY=192.168.99.1:0 dorakorpar/nsgui
